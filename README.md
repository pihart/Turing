A bodged-together transpiler from my advanced syntax for encoding Turing machines to the syntax accepted by https://turingmachinesimulator.com/.

Partially documented at link below (/docs/index.html) and partially documented in /examples directory. Function signatures can also be found in /transpiler.js.

Transpile twice when using functions to capture the two-stage transpilation process.
